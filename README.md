# ECE239-Computational-Imaging

This course was taken in 2018 Sep to 2018 Dec and it has 3 homeworks and a final project.

# Homework 1 (Template matching + NCC + Refocus image Synthesize):
Implement video-based template matching with Normalized Cross Corelation. The result was shown in the report Figure7, the plot of correlation coefficient matrix.

After that, pixels shifts in the selected template was calculated and ploted. Once you have the pixel shifts for each frame, you can synthesize refocused image by shifting each frame in the opposite direction and then summing up all the frames. The process was repeated on different templates in the scene captured.

# Homework 2 (Light transportation)

In the homework, the direct illumination and global illumination seperation method proposed in Nayar paper was implemented. 

Image-based relightning was also implemented with the self-captured images. Light Transport Matrix was also calculated.
